## Plurality

This one has some artificial constraints, described
[here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/3/plurality/).

We can only manage the `vote` function and the `print_winner` function,
everything else has to stay the same.

The function takes *n* names, a number of voters, then returns the candidate(s)
with the most votes.
