# Atoi Problem

## Only in C

It's unclear whether adding readmes with no data has any use, but maybe I'll
find its value later on. Recursion for me goes:

1. Set a base case.
1. Make the function do what you want it to do once, then exit.
1. Remove step two, figure out how to reduce the input a character at a time and
   return "done"
1. Re-add the function.

This isn't anything novel but recursion kinda stinks and doesn't feel practical
in terms of making code that is easy to maintain or share.

No check for this one.
