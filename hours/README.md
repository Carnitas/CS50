# Hours problem

## Only in C

Nothing so special here. The if-else condition could be shortened but we'd end
up with "If not T, then assume A", which feels like a bad foundation. On the
other hand, if we stuck to this gun, it can sum up to a lot of pedantry.

Would it be better to move the 'A' and 'T' checks into the function or their own
function?
