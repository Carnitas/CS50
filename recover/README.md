# Recover Problem

This program parses the included `card.raw` file to identify the number of
distinct jpgs found on the card.

This one was weird and my solution to set a flag when we found a new image is a
product of the CS50 duck, which is fine, I guess. I got stuck on only generating
25 of the known 50 images for reasons I'm still not sure I understand.

```
