# Prime Problem

## Only in C

I don't love hard-coding the primes lower than 10 but damned if I could figure
out how to calculate them. Throwing out all even numbers seems more efficient
than just checking if a given number is divisible by the iterator.

I also found that `sizeof()` behaved differently locally than remotely and had
to implement the wonky \`sizeof(arrray) / sizeof(array\[0\]) to get a legitimate
array size. Unsure how I got away with it before.
